# Project Title:
Electronic Ticketing with Live Booking for Public Transportation

# Overview:
This project presents a static web-based electronic ticketing system for public transportation. Passengers can easily book tickets and view journey details through a straightforward, browser-based interface.

# Functionality:
1. Web Application: The web application allows users to select their preferred bus type (ordinary, metro, metro deluxe), choose their source and destination, view journey details, submit their information, and receive a popup displaying ticket details including the source, destination, date of journey, validated time, and a "Happy Journey" greetings.
2. Booking Process:
Bus Selection: Passengers choose their preferred bus type (ordinary, metro, metro deluxe).
Route Selection: Passengers choose their starting point and destination within the web application.
Journey Details: Upon selecting "Proceed to Book," a popup displays journey details including source, destination, and date of travel.
3. Ticket Display: After viewing journey details, passengers can view the ticket information directly in the popup.
4. Verification: Passengers show the journey details popup to the conductor when requested.
